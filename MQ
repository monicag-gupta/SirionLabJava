We can start Pulsar locally using the Pulsar binaries:
Extract the tar folder downloaded 
Open Terminal at the bin folder of the downloaded tar folder
Run in terminal:
$ sudo vi ~/.bash_profile
$ sudo vi ./.profile
ecs + :q!
$ sudo chmod 777 pulsar
$ sudo ./pulsar standalone


This command starts Pulsar in standalone mode, which includes the Pulsar broker, BookKeeper, and ZooKeeper all in a single process. 
It will output logs to the console.
You should see messages indicating that Pulsar is starting up. 
Once it's running, you can access it at 
pulsar://localhost:6650.
