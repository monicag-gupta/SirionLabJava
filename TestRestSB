Few points to help us out optimize our build time as well as some pitfalls that might impact its speed:
Using profiles wisely – how profiles impact performance
Reconsidering @MockBean – how mocking hits performance
Refactoring @MockBean – alternatives to improve performance
Thinking carefully about @DirtiesContext – a useful but dangerous annotation and how not to use it
Using test slices – a cool tool that can help or get on our way
Using class inheritance – a way to organize tests in a safe manner
State management – good practices to avoid flakey tests
Refactoring into unit tests – the best way to get a solid and snappy build







Create a Maven Project: SpringBootTestPrj
Edit pom.xml
Create SpringBootHelloWorldApplication.java in package com.SpringBootTestPrj
Create the model class as Employee.java in package com.SpringBootTestPrj.model
Create the Controller class as TestController.java in com.SpringBootTestPrj.controllers
Code, Run and Check the Output
Create the Test class in src/test/java as SpringBootHelloWorldTests.java in com.SpringBootTestPrj.test
Next extend the SpringBootHelloWorldTests.java and write the test case for the TestController as: TestWebApp.java
Run this TestWebApp class as a JUnit test case.
