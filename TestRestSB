Few points to help us out optimize our build time as well as some pitfalls that might impact its speed:
Using profiles wisely – how profiles impact performance
Reconsidering @MockBean – how mocking hits performance
Refactoring @MockBean – alternatives to improve performance
Thinking carefully about @DirtiesContext – a useful but dangerous annotation and how not to use it
Using test slices – a cool tool that can help or get on our way
Using class inheritance – a way to organize tests in a safe manner
State management – good practices to avoid flakey tests
Refactoring into unit tests – the best way to get a solid and snappy build
