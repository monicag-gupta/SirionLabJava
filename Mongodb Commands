To create a database:
use javadb
The db does not get created till we insert a collection into it

To create collection:
Directly by inserting documents:
	db.Employee.insert ({	"Employeeid" : 1,	"EmployeeName" : "Martin"	})
	
	db.Employee.insert (	{
			"Employeeid" : 2,
			"EmployeeName" : "Mart"
		}
	)


By Command:
db.createCollection(name, options) 
name is the db name
Options:
Capped:
Boolean
(Optional) If it is set to true, enables a capped collection. Capped collection is a fixed size collection that automatically overwrites its oldest entries when it reaches its maximum size. If you specify true, you need to specify size parameter also.
AutoIndexID:
Boolean
(Optional) If it is set to true, automatically create index on ID field. Its default value is false.
Size:
Number
(Optional) It specifies a maximum size in bytes for a capped collection. If capped is true, then you need to specify this field also.
Max:
Number
(Optional) It specifies the maximum number of documents allowed in the capped collection.



Insert a document:
db.myColl.insert({"name" : "seomount"})
