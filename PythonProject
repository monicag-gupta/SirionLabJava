Hereâ€™s a comprehensive coding task in Python that involves multiple concepts, including file I/O, data manipulation, asynchronous programming, and working with APIs. 
Task: Create a Simple Employee Management System
Objectives:
Create a class to represent an employee.
Allow adding new employees and saving them to a CSV file.
Load existing employees from a CSV file.
Fetch employee data asynchronously from a public API.

Eg:
https://dummyjson.com/users

Display employee information.
This task combines several important concepts in Python:
Class Definition: Using classes to model data.
File I/O: Reading and writing CSV files.
Asynchronous Programming: Fetching data from an API using aiohttp.
Data Manipulation: Adding and displaying employee data






Project: Predicting Housing Prices
Objectives:
Load and preprocess a housing dataset.
Train a machine learning model to predict housing prices.
Evaluate the model's performance.
Visualize the predictions vs. actual values using Matplotlib.
Exploring different models (e.g., decision trees, random forests).
Performing feature engineering.
Tuning hyperparameters for better performance.
Trying different datasets for practice.
USE:
numpy 
pandas 
scikit-learn 
matplotlib 
seaborn (Study)
